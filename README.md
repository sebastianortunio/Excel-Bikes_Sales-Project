In this project, I performed data cleaning to ensure clarity and consistency in the dataset. I then organized the data using structured tables, followed by the creation of pivot tables and dynamic charts to enhance data interpretation. The final result is an interactive Excel dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into the store's performance. Users can filter the sales data by Marital Status, Region, and Education Level, enabling deeper and more personalized analysis.
